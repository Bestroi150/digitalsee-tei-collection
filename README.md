# DigitalSEE TEI-Transformed Collection

This repository houses the **DigitalSEE TEI-Transformed Collection**, a collection of digitally encoded texts based on the **[DigitalSEE](https://github.com/Bestroi150/DigitalSEE)** project. These texts have been encoded using the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) standards to ensure long-term preservation and accessibility.

The collection consists of multiple TEI-encoded works, which are part of a larger effort to document and preserve historical texts and artifacts related to key monuments, such as *Trajanâ€™s Gate* in modern-day Bulgaria.

## Streamlit TEI Navigator

To facilitate easier access to and querying of the collection, we have designed a special **Streamlit tool**. This tool allows you to view and interact with the TEI-encoded texts directly through an intuitive web interface. You can search, filter, and navigate the texts to explore specific sections or themes.
